Taking names and putting them into texts

This project was hacked together in order to answer the question, what if you could read a classic, cheesy Mills and Boon novel but with 
all the characters replaced by your friends? Using a bunch of Mills and Boon's novels these scripts replace the names with a selection of 
your choosing, just specify the genders of your friends and watch it go.
